# Facebook-VideoChatHeads

Why this repo?
--------------

This repo is created on the inspiration of Facebook Video profile feature which was introuduced in the recent release, as your can keep their Video instead of a profile image. But the implementation of this view is missing in the messenger chat heads (Since the Video profile users chat heads are even displayed as image). So I created this repo to show a VideoChatHeads for such users.

> **Note:** This repo is a custom implementation for VideoChatHeads. It is not an official repo of Facebook. Any kinds of suggestions or pull request are welcome and appreciated.
